 * key, but not on the value.
 * <p>
 * Let's take some example:
 * <pre>
 *   { "name" = "a" } => matches records with name set fo "a"
 *   { "color" = "*" } => matches records with "color" set
 *   { "color" = "red" } => only matches records with "color" set to "red"
 *   { "color" = "red", "name" = "a"} => only matches records with name set to "a", and color set to "red"
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * If the filter is not set (<code>null</code> or empty), it accepts all records.
 * <p>
 * This method returns the first matching record.

 * @param resultHandler handler called when the lookup has been completed. When there are no matching record, the operation succeeds, but the async result has no result (<code>null</code>).
